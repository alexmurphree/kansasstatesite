            <h3>Fun fact!</h3>
            <p>Topeka has an arts district that is lovingly referred to as "NoTo"!</p>
          </aside>
        <p>Founded in 1854, incorporated in 1857, Topeka has stood for freedom and equality since its conception. One of the focal points of Bleeding Kansas, Topeka has endured turmoil and torment to protect the beliefs that Kansans hold sacred.</p>
        <p>An urban city located in the northeastern part of the state, Topeka stands tall along the Kansas River. As of the 2020 census, Topeka has a population of 126,587, placing it as the fifth most populous city in Kansas. The average household income of the city is $35,928, placing it well below the overall state average of $56,422 (Greater Topeka Partnership).</p>

        <p>Although Topeka fought valiently for racial equality, Topeka is also home to the hate group, Westboro Baptist Church. While the Phelps family (Westboro founders) have bought most of the houses in the block of which they reside, in 2013 the nonprofit "Planting Peace" purchased a house directly across the street from the church. The nonprofit renovated the house and painted it in rainbow colors in solidarity with the LGBT community, one of Westboro's deepest hated groups (plantingpeace.org).</p>
