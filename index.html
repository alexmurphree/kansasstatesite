      <p>Settlers have lived on the Kansas land for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found evidence of people in the time of the mastodons, mammoths, and other prehistoric creatures.</p>
      <p>Indigenous tribes settled almost 800 years ago. When the Spanish arrived in 1541, the land was populated by many different tribes, such as the Cheyenne, Kiowa, Wichita, and more. The Spanish explored for at least 100 years, while other explorers from France and Canada soon joined. In 1803, the land was purchased by the 3rd President, Thomas Jefferson, in the Louisiana Purchase.</p>
      <p>The 34th state to join the Union, Kansas officially became a state in 1861. Kansas entered the Union as a free state, but during the Civil War, Kansas became a hotspot of fighting - known as "Bleeding Kansas". When the war ended, many soldiers settled in Kansas, as well as freed slaves (Kansas Historical Society, 2012).</p>

      <p> Kansas has maintained its place as an agricultural state for as long as historians can recall. While crops were the main export for years, eventually cattle were plentiful in the state as well.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Topeka was decided to be the state's capitol. Today, the state is home to 2.9 million people, ranking 36th in the country. Kansas is most known for <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, tornadic weather, and its beautiful sunsets.</p>
