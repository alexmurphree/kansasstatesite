      <p>During the height of Bleeding Kansas, Manhattan was incorporated as a free town in 1857. The northeastern town is not considered urban or rural by Kansas definition, rather a middle category defined as "metropolitan", due to the close care accessible, while still having medically underserved peoples. The median income is $48,289, placing it below the state average of $56,422.</p>
